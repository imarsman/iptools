This is a learning experience for things like IP subnetting. Mostly I am interested in splitting up subnets into equal
ranges and defining things like the network ID and broadcast address for subnets. This is a way for me to better
establish my knowledge of this subject.

It is very likely that if you read this there will be lots of errors and poor design choices in the code. I'll remove
this caveat in the future when the code is better.
